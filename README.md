# MyClassroom: Empowering Teachers, Supporting Every Child

## Introduction

MyClassroom is a command-line interface application running in a Python terminal. A classroom management tool born from an understanding of the diverse needs of students and the challenges faced by teachers in addressing them. MyClassroom aims to simplify the complex task of classroom management while ensuring that every child receives the care and attention they deserve. 

With MyClassroom, teachers gain access to a simple overview of their classrooms, allowing them to track students' medical or dietary needs, preferences, and behaviours effortlessly. From dietary restrictions to social anxieties, MyClassroom empowers teachers to provide personalized support, fostering an inclusive and nurturing learning environment for all.

## Project Inception

In the heart of every classroom lies a world of diversity, where each child brings their unique needs, fears, and joys. And it happens that we are lucky to have one joyful little person, who sometimes needs a little extra attention and care. I've often wondered at the incredible dedication of teachers who tirelessly work to ensure that every child feels safe, understood, and valued.

Little Joyful Person's journey sparked my curiosity about the complexities teachers face in managing classrooms. How do they remember each child's special instructions, fears, and preferences amidst the whirlwind of daily activities? How do they maintain a nurturing environment while juggling diverse needs and personalities?

I wondered about the tools available to teachers for sharing this important information across departments and the strategies for seamlessly transitioning responsibilities when a teacher is absent. These reflections ignited the idea for MyClassroom â€“ a simple software solution aimed at supporting teachers and enhancing the educational experience for every child. MyClassroom is a commitment to ensuring that every child receives the care and attention they deserve. With MyClassroom, teachers can effortlessly access a comprehensive overview of their classrooms, allowing them to track students' needs, preferences, and behaviours with ease. From dietary restrictions to social anxieties, MyClassroom empowers teachers to provide personalized support, creating an inclusive learning environment for all.

## Design

The design of the terminal interface for this project is intentionally kept minimalistic and raw, in line with the simplicity of a command-line interface. The focus is on functionality and usability rather than aesthetic appeal.

The interface primarily consists of plain text, with the exception of tables used to represent classroom data. These tables are drawn dynamically to provide a structured view of the classroom information.

To maintain clarity and simplicity, no colours or styling elements have been added to the interface. This decision was made to ensure that the interface remains accessible and easy to navigate for users who may be unfamiliar with more complex graphical interfaces.

Despite its simplicity, the interface effectively fulfils its purpose. It provides users with a straightforward menu system that allows them to easily access the necessary functionalities of the application.

## Data Model

Google Sheets was chosen as the data storage method for this project, integrated through Google Cloud API services.

- **[This link will take you to Google Spreadsheet used for this project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1569A0UBfqTsWflyTsJghV21NA02UaznB9tdeAba-fno/edit?usp=sharing)**

The Google Sheet is divided into multiple worksheets, with each worksheet representing a classroom. For example, worksheets may be titled "2A", "2B", "2C", etc., where each represents a distinct classroom.

![Worksheets](/assets/images/data-model/worksheets.png)

Additionally, there is an extra worksheet called "sid" (abbreviation for student ID), which is not associated with any specific classroom. This worksheet serves the sole purpose of tracking student IDs, with each new student created incrementing the student ID count by one. This ensures that the student ID tracker remains intact even in the event of system malfunctions.

![Student Id counter](/assets/images/data-model/student-id-counter.png)

The structure of each classroom worksheet includes the following columns:

- Student ID
- Name
- Allergies
- Dietary Requirements
- Medication
- Special Needs
- Notes

This structure allows for organized and efficient management of student information, ensuring that important details are easily accessible and properly tracked for each student.
